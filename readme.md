> (WIP) Home for [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification)-powered services for cloud-scale applications.

When used in conjunction it is possible to develop highly secure, traceable, and dynamic real-time applications that
are relentlessly designed to reach cloud-scale by distributing loads across queues. JSON-RPC is used to provide 
a language/transport-agnostic protocol for maximum flexibility with simplified event sourcing.
